## What Qualifies as a Security Issue

A security issue is any vulnerability that could:

- Allow unauthorized access to data
- Enable authentication bypass or privilege escalation
- Permit SQL injection or other code execution attacks
- Compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system
- Allow denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Expose sensitive information (credentials, tokens, private data)
- Bypass security controls or safety mechanisms
- Affect the security posture of applications using sqlalchemy-cubrid

Examples include:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in query construction
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Insecure credential handling
- Cryptographic weaknesses

Once a security vulnerability is fixed:

1. A security patch will be released
2. The vulnerability will be disclosed in release notes
3. An advisory may be published on GitHub Security Advisories
4. Credit will be given to the reporter (if requested)

We appreciate your responsible disclosure and help in keeping sqlalchemy-cubrid secure.
